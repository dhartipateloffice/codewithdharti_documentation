1.face track
2.fitness app for real time pose estimation 
3.Hand gesture
4.Bitmoji
5.snapchat filters
6.Fitness and health applications
Fitness and health applications: Track body movements for exercise analysis, physical therapy exercises, or yoga pose detection.
Sign language translation: Recognize hand gestures and translate them into spoken language or text in real-time.
Interactive games and experiences: Develop games that use hand gestures, facial expressions, or body pose as controls

Want to start building body pose based apps?
Maybe want to control your screen using nothing but gestures!
Well, Mediapipe and Python are the answer! 
we can do it with Body pose detection, facial landmark estimation and hand pose detection using a single Mediapipe library and your webcam.

Behind the scenes, Mediapipe Holistic, the model shown in this video, uses deep learning models to be able to accurately detect keypoints.

pip install mediapipe opencv-python
import mediapipe as mp
import cv2

use attributes of mediapipe and perform it
1. Install Mediapipe and setup Mediapipe Holistic for Python
2. Access a real time video feed from your webcam using OpenCV
3. Detect and visualise facial landmarks, body poses and hand poses
